# Block 8. Modulation and Synchronization

## Purpose
This block introduces digital modulation, demodulation, and core synchronization mechanisms in time, frequency, and phase.

## Why this block matters
It turns SDR from a tone-observation tool into an information-transmission system and links DSP to an actual receiver.

## Main topics
- BPSK, QPSK, and basic constellations;
- pulse shaping;
- symbol timing recovery;
- carrier and phase synchronization;
- decision devices and BER;
- debugging a modulator and a demodulator.

## Practical work
- building a modulator-channel-demodulator chain;
- observing constellations and eye diagrams;
- experiments with frequency and timing mismatch;
- estimating synchronization errors and reception quality.

## Tooling for the block
The main toolset is: MATLAB, Simulink, GNU Radio, Python.

## Expected outputs
- constellations before and after synchronization;
- BER or decision-error plots;
- synchronization-chain description;
- modulation/demodulation report.

3. inject synchronization errors and compensate them.
4. formulate limits and conclusions.

## Real hardware BPSK — spectrum, constellation & SNR/EVM

Real measured BPSK from the course board (Zynq-7020 + AD9361): the same three quantities you
compute in theory — **power spectrum**, **constellation**, and **SNR / EVM** — taken from the
running hardware, comparing the on-chip FPGA receiver in AD9361 **digital loopback** with an
**independent RTL-SDR over the air**.

![Board PL RX — spectrum and constellation (AD9361 digital loopback)](https://lay007.github.io/zynq-sdr-course/assets/hw_bpsk_board_spectrum_constellation.png)

![RTL-SDR — over-the-air BPSK constellation](https://lay007.github.io/zynq-sdr-course/assets/hw_bpsk_rtl_ota_constellation.png)

| Metric | Board PL RX (digital loopback) | RTL-SDR (over the air, ~10 cm) |
|---|---|---|
| EVM | ≈ 1.6 % | ≈ 10.6 % |
| SNR (from EVM) | ≈ 36 dB | ≈ 19.5 dB |
| Carrier frequency offset | 0 (digital, no carrier) | ≈ +2.7 kHz |
| BER | 0 | 0 |

The internal loopback isolates the *modem* — two tight clusters at I = ±1, Q ≈ 0, no carrier.
Over the air the *radio channel* spreads the clusters with noise and rotates them with the
carrier frequency offset (Lab 8.1 / 8.2 seen on real hardware), yet at close range it still
decodes at BER 0. The visual gap between the two constellations *is* the RF channel. Full
walkthrough, numbers and reproduction: **[Lab 8.7 — Real-hardware BPSK metrics](https://github.com/Lay007/zynq-sdr-course/blob/main/blocks/block_08_modulation_and_synchronization/lab_8_7_real_hardware_bpsk_metrics.md)**.

## QPSK — two bits per symbol, impairments & BER

QPSK is two independent BPSK axes (Gray-coded: low bit → I, high bit → Q), so it doubles the
bit rate at the same bandwidth. A synthesizable QPSK modem reusing the shared upsampler / RRC /
sampler recovers a full frame at **BER = 0** in HDL loopback; a channel simulation then shows
what the two impairments of this block do to it:

![Gray QPSK constellation under impairments](https://lay007.github.io/zynq-sdr-course/assets/qpsk_constellation_impairments.png)

Four clean points → noise-spread clouds → (at low Eb/N0) clouds crossing the axes = bit errors;
an uncorrected **carrier frequency offset rotates the four points into a ring**, undecodable
until a carrier-recovery loop de-rotates it (Lab 8.1 / 8.2).

![Gray QPSK BER vs Eb/N0](https://lay007.github.io/zynq-sdr-course/assets/qpsk_ber_vs_ebn0.png)

Being two orthogonal BPSK axes, Gray QPSK has the same per-bit BER as BPSK,
`Q(√(2·Eb/N0))` — the simulation matches theory across 0–10 dB. Full walkthrough:
**[Lab 8.8 — QPSK modem, impairments and BER](https://github.com/Lay007/zynq-sdr-course/blob/main/blocks/block_08_modulation_and_synchronization/lab_8_8_qpsk_modem_and_impairments.md)**.

## QPSK carrier recovery — de-rotating the CFO ring

The CFO ring above is undecodable (BER ≈ 0.5) until a **carrier-recovery loop** de-rotates it.
A decision-directed **Costas loop** (NCO + PI loop filter + QPSK phase-error detector — the
frequency-domain twin of the Gardner timing loop) drives the ring back onto the four points and
tracks the CFO ramp:

![QPSK carrier recovery](https://lay007.github.io/zynq-sdr-course/assets/qpsk_carrier_recovery.png)

The one twist BPSK does not have: the loop locks to one of four `k·90°` rotations, so the
constellation looks perfect but the bit labelling may be rotated (the **90° ambiguity**). The
same **known preamble** the modem uses for frame sync resolves it — turning the noisy BER back
into a flat **BER = 0** across the whole CFO sweep. Full walkthrough:

## Next step
After finishing this block, the student should be ready to reuse its results as the starting point for the next stage of the course and the related practical experiment.
